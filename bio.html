        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Elizabeth, or Liz as she prefers to be called, was born in Belleville, Canada in 1991. From a young age, she was active on and off in sports but was neither<br>
        passionate nor competitive. Swimming, hockey, volleyball--none of these seemed to light up her spirit or inspire her to excel. School was much the same with only<br>
        and the occasional Physical Education class sparking her interest and demanding her energy. Often a frustrating experience, school was often a glorified daycare <br>
        for Liz and she acted out and became complacent with life. After finally earning her high school diploma, Liz moved in with a hostile boyfriend and the relationship<br>
        took an enormous mental toll on her. One day, while riding a bus home, she saw the sign that would change her life. In simple, blocky black letters it seemed to shout<br>
        to her <b>BEGINNER KICKBOXING STARTS APRIL 4</b> which became a reimaging of my whole self-perception and a guiding light out of a difficult time in my life.<br>
        <br>
        Since 2010, Liz has been practicing Muay Thai primarily under the the instruction of Kelly Westerlund, owner and head coach of <a href="https://www.kwestkickboxing.com/">Kwest Muay Thai</a> in Winnipeg, Canada.

        <p><h2>Teaching and Philosophy</h2>
        I have been teaching beginner Muay Thai at the Colosseum in Aarhus, Denmark since Summer of 2021 and have introduced fighting to many curious students.<br>
        "My philosophy about kickboxing classes is it should be 60% fun and 40% grind. No one wants to come to a class and feel like their in military basic training.<br>
        But even though I make it fun, everyone leaves drenched in sweat."<br>
        Currently, I teach beginner Muay Thai at the Colosseum, running both a non-profit class and my own private lessons for women.<br>
        These ladies' classes take place in the morning, an often neglected part of the day for combat sports clubs, on Mondays and Wednesdays, and a catch-all<br>
        class at 11:30 am on Sundays. For those curious about the private lessons and can't make it for evening classes, come <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/360318776126340/">join the facebook group!</a></strong><br>
